## How to calculate result?
Below will be the data sample

{
  "-LtHYNsaoggd9V9hUv_q" : {
    "id" : "https://wangx733.github.io/Experimentation/",
    "time" : 1.573343039012E9
  },
  "-LtHYw4BBDXsbM-79SMT" : {
    "id" : "https://wangx733.github.io/Experimentation/",
    "time" : 1.573343183179E9
  },
  "-LtHYyB5Gptc6Jv91l3j" : {
    "id" : "https://wangx733.github.io/Experimentation/",
    "time" : 1.573343191813E9
  },
  "-LtHZ7J-Wv8kpMLzLLKx" : {
    "id" : "https://wangx733.github.io/Experimentation/",
    "time" : 1.57334323328E9
  },
  "-LtHZBJEoL8_5ohHpMHh" : {
    "id" : "https://wangx733.github.io/Experimentation/test.html",
    "time" : 1.573343249678E9
  }
}

Group data with the same id, then pick the one with a smaller time.
The percentage of test determine the attractiveness of the speed element.

## Result

We sent out ~87 emails (13 to go)
About Half of Emails went through
Of these we got 14 Responses via clicks on the forms
Of the clicks, no conclusive evidence
Of the 14 Clicks, 7 people clicked the test link first, and 7 people clicked the normal link first
so 50% each
10 people clicked the test link overall
10 people clicked the train link overall
so the number of clicks, and percentage of which links were clicked first were identical for each link (the normal one, and then the test one where we incentivize transparency and 3 weeks)

## Conclusion
People do not care about the speed when searching for job.
